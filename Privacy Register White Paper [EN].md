# Privacy Register White Paper

Article 30 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) brings into existence an obligation for controllers and processors to maintain a record of processing activities. The aim of this White Paper is to create an open standard that could be used to fulfil this obligation. 

This White Paper contains an assessment of the legal requirements that follow from article 30 GDPR. It serves as a basis for the specifications of the open standard and contains the following:

1. An explanation of the legal and theoretical framework and structure of article 30 GDPR, taking into account:
	- Recitals of the regulation
	- Literature
2. An elaboration of our own position with regard to the framework and the open standard.

## Legal and theoretical framework

1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)	
	1. Background
		- The GDPR was adopted on 27 April 2016 and takes effect on 25 May 2018.
		- The GDPR replaces the data protection directive (Directive 95/46/EC) of 1995.
		- As a regulation it is directly applicable in all EU countries.
	2. Objective
		- The objective of the GDPR can be found in article 1 of the regulation:
			- **Article 1(1)**
			- *This Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.*
		- An explanation in greater depth can be found in the recitals of the GDPR:
			- **Recital 7**
			- *Those developments (globalisation and rapid technological developments, ed.) require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by strong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop across the internal market*
		- The European legislator stresses in recitals 1 to 7 that the regulation also aims to provide a high level of protection in order to guarantee the fundamental right to the protection of personal data.

2. Article 30 GDPR

	- Ratio

		- Article 30 must be read in the light of the principles relating to processing of personal data as summed up in article 5 GDPR.
		- The obligation to maintain a record of processing activities aims to:
		1. Increase the transparancy regarding the processing of personal data; 
		2. Fill in the accountability of organisations; and
		3. Serve as a basis for other compliance requirements.

	- Terminology

		- **Personal data**

			- Article 4(1) GDPR defines 'personal data' as:
			- *any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;*

			- Recital 26 of the GDPR states that to determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly.

		- **Processing (activity)**

			- Article 4(2) GDPR defines 'processing' as: 
			- *any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;*

		- **Controller**

			- Article 4(7) GDPR defines 'controller' as:
			- *the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;*

		- **Processor**

			- Article 4(8) GDPR defines 'processor' as:
			- *a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;*
